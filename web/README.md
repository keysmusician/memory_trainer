# Memory Trainer
This is the web demo of my memory training algorithm.

## Why this tool?
A lot of online tools for memorization simply use (pseudo-) randomization for shuffling items you are trying to memorize. What makes this tool unique is that it tracks your accuracy and assigns a higher probability to items that you answer incorrectly, and likewise decreases the probability of presenting items you have less difficulty with.

## To-do
- Add a quiz configuration screen
- Add a quiz builder interface
- Need a way to add & select quiz presets, which are basically sub-quizzes, so should quizzes form tree structures?
