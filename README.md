# Why this tool?
A lot of online tools for memorization simply use (pseudo-) randomization for shuffling items you are trying to memorize. What makes this tool unique is that it tracks your accuracy and assigns a higher probability to items that you answer incorrectly, and likewise decreases the probability of presenting items you have less difficulty with.
