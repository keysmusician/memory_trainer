# Memory Trainer
This is the web demo of my memory training algorithm. This algorithm helps train associative memory by presenting incorrectly answered questions with a higher probability than correctly answered questions.

# Why this tool?
I was inspired to create this because I noticed a drawback in an online music notation sight reading training tool that I used with my piano students. It's a great tool for learning to sight read, but it presents notes randomly. When I personally teach sight reading, I try to go over the notes my students have difficulty with more frequently than other notes. I wrote this algorithm to imitate that approach. This tool tracks your accuracy and assigns a higher probability to questions that you answer incorrectly, and likewise decreases the probability of presenting items you have less difficulty with.
